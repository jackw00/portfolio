      `The Cardiology Application was created by myself and four other team members of the Dream Team Engineering Software Division. The application allows doctors to demonstrate the process of 
      an LVAD (left ventricular assist device) implant to patients. It has a demonstration heart for any user to see and manipulate with the implant. Additionally, there is a password protected
      section of the web application that allows doctors to upload a specific patient's CT-scan as DICOM files, which are then converted into an STL and rendered in an interactive 3D space with the LVAD implant.
      This allows doctor's to show their patients what the LVAD implant process looks like on their heart.`,

      `This project was done as part of the UF Dream Team Engineering 24-hour Designathon competition. I worked with two team members to design a web application and 
      medicine storage box to make taking medicine fun for children. The web application allows users to store and view their medicine and 
      'grow their frog' each time they take their medicine. The end prodcut also includes a 3D printed frog pill box 
      with an embedded near field communication (NFC) tag, allowing users to tap their phone on the pill box and be 
      redirected to the web application. 'Froggy Pill' earned the People's Choice Award at the competition.`,

      `This project was created for COP3530 (Data Strucutres & Algorithms) at the University of Florida. 
      I collaborated with 2 other students to create a command-line application that allows users to organize 
      crimes in Chicago by community area and street name using the QuickSort and TimSort algorithms. 
      This can help traveleres make informed decisions about safe and dangerous areas of the city, based on 100,000+ crimes from 2020.`,

      Meat, Vegetable, or Side. Then, they can randomly generate any of these three categories, or a meal which consists of one item from each category. The purpose of the application
      is to help users decide what to eat from a user built database of their favorite foods.`,
